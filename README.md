# 🚢 Titanic Survival Analysis – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This project dives into the iconic Titanic dataset to uncover survival patterns using Python-based data analysis and visualization techniques.

## 📊 Project Overview

Using Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib, this EDA explores key factors influencing survival rates, revealing insights based on gender, class, fare, family size, and port of embarkation.

## 🔍 Key Insights

- 💡 **Females** had a survival rate ~2.7× higher than males.
- 💰 Passengers **paying higher fares** had better survival odds.
- 🛏️ **1st class passengers** were significantly more likely to survive than those in 2nd and 3rd class.
- 🧳 Passengers **embarking from Port C** had the best survival chances.
- 👨‍👩‍👧 Smaller families (2–4 members) fared better than larger ones.
- 👤 **Solo travelers** were the least likely to survive.
- 📅 Surprisingly, **age had no significant impact** on survival.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python 3.x  
- Pandas  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  
- Jupyter Notebook
